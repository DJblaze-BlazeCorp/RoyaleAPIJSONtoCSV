Ensure you have the correct API key when using the script.

Get your IPv4 address from a reliable source such as WhatIsMyIP (https://www.whatismyip.com/).

Generate your own API key by visiting the Clash Royale Developer portal here: https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/.

In the script, only edit the 'KEY' variable to input your generated API key. Failure to do so might result in the script not functioning correctly.

The script contains a randomly generated key, which won't work on your computer unless you replace it with your properly generated key.

Feel free to customize the script to suit your needs, but ensure that the API key is correctly entered for proper functionality.
