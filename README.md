**Clash Royale Data Converter and Organizer**

This Python script is the result of a unique approach to software development. Crafted by leveraging ChatGPT, an AI language model, this script streamlines Clash Royale data management and analysis. It first retrieves player data from the RoyaleAPI, storing it in a JSON file for comprehensive representation. Subsequently, the JSON data is converted into a CSV file, enabling seamless formatting and manipulation with tools like Google Sheets or Excel. The script further organizes the CSV data into a systematic folder directory, enhancing accessibility and management. Timestamps are added to each dataset, providing a clear timeline of data retrieval.

**Features:**
- Created with ChatGPT, an AI language model.
- Fetches player data from the RoyaleAPI for Clash Royale.
- Stores data in a JSON file for comprehensive representation.
- Converts JSON data into a CSV file for easy formatting and manipulation.
- Organizes CSV data into a systematic folder directory for enhanced accessibility.
- Timestamps each dataset, providing clarity on data retrieval timelines.
- Efficiently stores player tags and usernames in a single file for easy access in the future.
- Developed in a short span of about 2 days, with approximately 3 consecutive hours per day, showcasing adaptability for future modifications to handle various HTTP requests.

**Usage:**
1. Execute the script and provide the player tag as prompted.
2. Player data is retrieved from the RoyaleAPI and stored in a JSON file.
3. JSON data is converted into a CSV file for convenient formatting and manipulation.
4. CSV data is organized into a structured folder directory for improved management.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- RoyaleAPI Key (Ensure the 'Authorization' header contains your API key)

**Note:**
Before running the script, update the 'Authorization' header with your actual RoyaleAPI key. The JSON-to-CSV conversion enables easy formatting and manipulation of data using software like Google Sheets or Excel. The organized folder directory enhances accessibility and management of datasets, with timestamps offering clarity on data retrieval timelines. The inclusion of player tags and usernames in a single file enhances future access to pertinent data. The script's development time highlights its adaptability for handling various HTTP requests and modifications.
